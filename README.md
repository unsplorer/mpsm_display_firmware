# mpsm_display_firmware
Do you have a mpsmV2 that needs some trickin out??! Look no further for what here is some t r i c k e d o u t
firmware!!!!! Youll need platformio to build. Connect VCC gnd TX and RX to the display board, hold encoder button
down while booting (GPIO 0) to set esp into flash mode then flash this firmware! Ive included a backup of the stock
firmware too, in case you messed up.
